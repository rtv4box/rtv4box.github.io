# **Animation in Multimedia**
**March 14th, 2023**

Animation is created through a series of still images that can be preceived as movement by seamlessly altering consecutive images.

## Benefits of Animations

Unlike simple text or still images on a presentation slide, animation can help provide useful information to others while also being entertaining to watch. They provide another layer of depth to the information you present which can help differentiate your work from others.

Animations can also help provide a deeper understanding on complex subjects/concepts that may be difficult to understand through diagrams. This means that the text presented in a website can be drastically cut down because the animation can do the explaining while also complementing the text.

## 2 Types of Animations

### Cel Animation

### Computer Animation
