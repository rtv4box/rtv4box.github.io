## Steps for Creating a Film

### Step 1: Outline Your Idea

The first step is to think of a story that will be told through your film. This includes drafting out general details that will make up the elements of your story such as: characters, scenario, problem, etc. Ideas can pop up at any time, it may be a good idea to keep something with you to save any ideas that pop up.

### Step 2: Write Out Your Script

The next step is to turn your idea into a written script, which will not only include the characters and story that you already thought out but also specific details like the dialogues of each character. The script is not final, you can change it later on as you see fit. If you have trouble writing a script, feel free to let the actors improvise the scenes to help you generate something more concrete.

### Step 3: Create Storyboards for Each Shot

Each storyboard will include how the shot should be taken, where the actors are located, and whether there should be movements with the camera. This step helps with visualizing the scenes in the film and what is possible with each shot.

### Step 4: Decide on the Actors and Crew Members

The people that will be participating in the film making process should have the experiences that match what you are looking for. You can hold auditions to determine who the best candidate for each role is.

### Step 5: Determine the Setting

You may need to do some scouting to find out what locations will work best for each scene, remember to bring a camera with you to snap some photos of potiental locations. You should consider the amount of space that will be needed to fit the actors and for each scene.

### Step 6: Gather the Required Materials

Scene not only need actors but also physical items like props and costumes. Make sure that you remember to list down what items you have used or plan to use so that things stay consistent between scenes.

### Step 7: Shoot the Film

The filming should follow a schedule so that tasks do not drag behind. Give yourself plenty of time ahead so that you can make accommodations for last minute changes. Feel free to film the same shot multiple times so that later on you can pick out what looks best.

### Step 8: Post-Production

This final step takes even longer than the actual filming process. Individual scenes will need to be joined together and topped with things like sounds effects, background music, and colour adjustments.
