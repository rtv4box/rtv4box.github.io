## Two Types of Still Images

Bitmap images are formed from a large group of pixels that are placed within a grid layout. As shown in the image below, each individual pixel has their own digital colour information. When combined together, we can perceive an image.

Vector images are made up of vectors. Each vector consists of a pair of coordinates in 2D or 3D space. They can form lines, curves, and even shapes. Unlike bitmap images, vector images can be resized without distortion because they are created through mathematical equations. The image below shows a heart in the form of a vector image.

## Common Image File Types

**PNG - Portable Network Graphics**

These are often used to save a particular image with a transparent background, which makes it great for websites.

**JPEG/JPG - Joint Photographic Experts Group**

JPG and JPEG are the same image file type. These images are widely popular and can be viewed on most devices. They can also produce very high quality photographs.

**GIF - Graphics Interchange Format**

GIFs are often seen on the internet in an animated form. They are often low quality because GIFs are limited to a 256 colour palette.

**TIFF - Tagged Image File**

These type of images use lossless compression which means that they don't lose quality after compression. Unfortunately, this is drawback on its usability for general websites since they take forever to load.

**PSD - Photoshop Document**

As the name implies, these image files are made by Adobe Photoshop. They contain layers which make editing them significantly easier.

**PDF - Portable Document Format**

PDF files can contain a wide range of multimedia elements, include videos. They don't require additional software to enable these features and will function as long as you have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed on your system.
